## Project Overview

NexaLink is a telecommunications provider offering internet, phone, and streaming services to residential customers. The company faces a critical churn problem: **26.5% of its customer base (1,869 of 7,043 customers) has churned**, representing an estimated **$1.67 million in annualised revenue loss** — equivalent to **30.5% of total monthly revenue**.

This project investigates the root drivers of churn across seven analytical dimensions, quantifies the financial impact of each segment, and delivers a prioritised retention strategy with ROI projections. The analysis follows a structured framework: **Observation → Insight → Impact → Recommendation**.

**Role:** Data Analyst — responsible for data preparation, exploratory analysis, semantic model design, DAX measure creation, and report development in Power BI.

## Tools Used

- **Power BI** — Dashboard design, DAX measures, data modelling (TMDL/PBIP format)
- **Microsoft Excel** — Data source, schema design, data cleaning
- **GitHub** — Version control and portfolio publishing

## Data Model

Star schema with one fact table and four dimension tables, all joined on `Customer_ID` with bidirectional cross-filtering:

| Table | Type | Key Columns |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `fact_churn` | Fact | Customer_ID, Monthly_Charge_USD, Churned, Tenure_Months, Ticket counts |
| `dim_customer` | Dimension | Customer_ID, Gender, Senior_Citizen, Has_Partner, Has_Dependents |
| `dim_billing` | Dimension | Customer_ID, Contract_Type, Payment_Method, Paperless_Billing |
| `dim_services` | Dimension | Customer_ID, Internet_Service_Type, Add-on subscriptions |
| `dim_support` | Dimension | Customer_ID, Admin_Tickets_Count, Tech_Tickets_Count |

> [!NOTE]
> The one-to-one cardinality in this model is intentional and correct for this
> dataset. The source data was a single wide customer table split into logical
> subject areas (demographics, billing, services, support) for analytical
> clarity. Each customer has exactly one row in every table. This is not a
> transactional fact table with repeated measures — it is a customer-level
> snapshot. One-to-one simplifies the model and avoids the ambiguous filter
> propagation that one-to-many relationships introduce in bidirectional setups.

## Key Findings

- **Month-to-month contracts drive 88.6% of churn** — customers on flexible terms churn at 42.7%, 15× the rate of two-year contract customers (2.8%)
- **A single tech support ticket triples churn probability** — from 19.7% (0 tickets) to 65.6% (1+ tickets), the sharpest churn inflection point in the dataset
- **Fiber optic customers churn at 41.9%** and account for 69.4% of all churned customers, despite being only 44% of the base
- **Electronic check users churn at 45.3%** — 2.7–3.0× the rate of automatic payment customers — representing ~60% of total churn volume
- **Protective add-ons cut churn by more than half** — customers without online security churn at 41.8% vs. 14.6% for those with it (2.86× multiplier)
- **Compound risk peaks at 78.9% churn** — customers with both high charges (>$70.35) and 2+ tech tickets are nearly 5× more likely to leave than the baseline
